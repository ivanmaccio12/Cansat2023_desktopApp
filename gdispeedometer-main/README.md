# gdispeedometer
A simple C# WIndows Forms User Control, displaying a "Speedometer Gauge".
There are a couple of properties customizable (boundaries, colors, fonts, styles, ecc).
There's also an example app that you can build, to test the control.

All is contained in a single file, without external resources (all is made upon GDI graphic),
so the file can easily be put in other projects, and the User Control picked up from the ui components bar.

Feel free to improve and modify it as per your needs.
